In this assignment we went through:

1- We initiated Q matrix for all V's. the value was calculated by the formula, and we iterated through verteces and calculated the Q for each

2- We used the same cost function in the algorithm

3- When collapsing an edge we combined Q1 and Q2 for the new Q' that is the new vertex, and the cost was inserted like the algorithm

4- Most of the collapse edge function that we had was not changed, only some parts.

The hardest part was: understanding the entire data base and implemnting the 40%, because it had a lot of math.
